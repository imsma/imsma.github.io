## Identity Properties / Identity Numbers
*Identity number* for a *mathematical operation* is such a number that will have no impact on the result, *identity numbers* are also known as *identity properties*. In this article we will explore what identity numbers are in context of addition and multiplication.

### Additive Identity
$0$ (zero) is the identity number for *addition*, adding $0$ to any number will have no effect on the result. You can see in following examples that adding $0$ to any other number has no effect at all.

\\[
x + 0 = x
\\]

\\[
1000 + 0 = 1000
\\]

### Multiplicative Identity
For *multiplication*, the *identity number* is $1$ (one), A *number* or *expression* will retain it's identify if we **multiply* it with $1$, following examples show this behavior.

\\[
x \times 1 = x
\\]

\\[
1000 \times 1 = 1000
\\]

## Associative, Commutative and Distributive Properties of Addition and Multiplication

In this section we will explore the laws for *associative*, *commutative* and *distributive* properties applied to  addition and multiplication operations in math.

### Associativity: Associative Property / Law

In mathematics, the associative property[1] is a property of some binary operations. In propositional logic, associativity is a valid rule of replacement for expressions in logical proofs [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associative_property). The word *associative* comes from the word *associate* or *associate*. *Associative law* states that the answer of an *algebraic expression* will remain same no matter what the *order* of it's elements is. The *Associative law* or *Associative property* is applicable to both *addition* and *multiplication* expressions, let's make it more clear with some practical examples.

#### Associative Property / Law of Addition

Following equations explain the associative property of addition operation. 

\\[
(x + y ) + z  = x + (y + z)
\\]

\\[
(3 + 2 ) + 5  = 3 + (2 + 5)
\\]

#### Associative Property / Law of Multiplication

Following equations explain the associative property of multiplication operation.

\\[
(x * y ) * z  = x * (y * z)
\\]

\\[
(3 * 2 ) * 5  = 3 * (2 * 5)
\\]

### Commutativity: Commutative Property
According to *Commutative law* the answer of *multiplication operation* in an *algebraic expression* will remain same, even if we change the order of the members of this expression [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commutative_property). The word *Commutative* is derived from *commute* and in mathematics it states that re-arranging the elements of an *algebraic* expression will not affect the resultant value. *Commutative law* is also applicable to both *addition* and *multiplication* expressions, let's make it more clear with some practical examples.

#### Commutativity Property of Addition / Commutative Law of Addition

Following equations explain the commutative property of addition operation.

\\[
x + y = y + x
\\]

\\[
3 + 2 = 2 + 3
\\]

#### Commutativity Property of Multiplication / Commutative Law of Multiplication

Following equations explain the commutative property of multiplication operation.

\\[
x * y = y * x
\\]

\\[
3 * 2 = 2 * 3
\\]
