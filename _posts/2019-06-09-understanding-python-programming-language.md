**Python** is a powerful *dynamically typed*, *interpreted* and *object oriented* high level programming language for **Rapid Application Development**. *Python* was created in 1991 by *Guido van Rossum* as a multi-purpose programming language with *easy to use* and *simple* syntax.

## What makes Python Good
Following are some of the important features of *Python programming language*.

### Simple and Expressive Syntax
Python has a simple syntax with focus on solution rather than syntax, which makes it easy for programmers to write programs in *Python*.

### Portability (Write once run everywhere)
Software programs written in *Python* are *platform independent*; this means you can execute programs written in python on all supported platform (including Windows , macOS and Linux) without making any changes in your code.

### Broad Collection of Standard Libraries
Python has a huge set of standard libraries, which enables rapid application development without reinventing the wheel.

### Extendable and Embeddable
You can extend the functionality of *Python* programs by writing *Python Modules* in *C* or *C++* and on the other hand *Python* itself can be embedded in applications written in *C* or *C++* to enable scripting using *Python* language.

### Object Oriented Language
Python supports *Object Oriented Programming* language.



## Python 2 vs. Python 3

There are two available flavors of Python, Python 2 and Python 3. Python 3 is the recommended version for development of new applications as Python 2 is approaching it's *end of life* in *2020*.


## Python Implementations

*Python* itself is a programming language specification that is implemented by different vendors. In this section we will explore some of the major implementations of *Python* language.

### CPython

The reference implementation written in *C* is [CPython](https://www.python.org){:target="_blank"}. *CPython* compiles the source code to intermediate bytecode which is then executed by the *CPython Runtime or Virtual Machine*. *CPython* enables us to extend the functionality using modules written in native *C*.


### Jython

The implementation of *Python* for *JVM (Java Virtual Machine)* is known [Jython](http://www.jython.org){:target="_blank"}. Jython compiles the source code to *JVM bytecode* that will be executed by *JVM*. Jython enables use of Java code and libraries as Python modules.

### IronPython

[IronPython](http://ironpython.net){:target="_blank"} is the Python implementation for *.NET Framework*. IronPython enables us to use .NET Framework code and libraries from within the Python code.

## Python Distributions

Following are few of most popular distributions other than official [CPython](https://www.python.org){:target="_blank"} distribution.

### ActivePython

[ActivePython](https://www.activestate.com/products/activepython/){:target="_blank"} is *Python programming language* implementation provided by [ActiveState](http://www.activestate.com){:target="_blank"}. *ActivePython* is available for all major platforms including *Microsoft Windows*, *macOs* and *Linux*.

### Anaconda

[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com){:target="_blank"} is an open source *Python* distribution. *Anaconda* distribution also includes implementation [R Language](https://www.r-project.org/about.html){:target="_blank"} for statistical computing. *An* uses [Anaconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/){:target="_blank"} for package managment and provides a user firendly GUI based installer for all major platforms including *Microsoft Windows*, *macOs* and *Linux*.


In next section we explore different approaches to execute Python code.
