In this article we will explore following concepts in *Python programming language*.

- Values
- Data Types
- Variables
- Statements
- Expressions
- Operators
- Order of operations
- String Operations
- Getting User Input in terminal / console mode
- Composition
- Comments

## Values in Python

In python **value** is a thing that code / program can manipulate, *values* can be either be *numeric* or *text*. 

```python
print(5)
```
When executed, the above statement will print value `5` on terminal screen. Following example uses a text/string value `Hello Python` and prints it using python's `print` function.

```python
print("Hello Python")
```

Following example uses two values `5`, `3` and adds them using `+` operator.

```python
5+3
```

## Data Types

**Values** belong to different data types, following table lists some common data types in *Python*.

{:class="table table-responsive "}
| Value             | Data Type     |
|-------------------|---------------|
| "Hello Python"    | string        |
| 5                 | integer       |
| 74.12             | float         |

Python is a dynamically typed language i,e. data type will be assigned automatically according to type of value used in assignment statement. 

You can determine the data type of a value programmatically using `type()` function as shown in following example.

```python
type(5)
```

If you run the above piece of code in `ipython` (Interactive Python Interpreter), it will print following output.

```
int
```

### Tip
\\\ You can run the *IPython interpreter* by running `iphython` command in terminal.
