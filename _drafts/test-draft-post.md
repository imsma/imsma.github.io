This is a draft post to test the feature.

Here is the **Jekyll** refernce [documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/) 

****

Drafts are posts without a date in the filename. They’re posts you’re still working on and don’t want to publish yet. To get up and running with drafts, create a _drafts folder in your site’s root and create your first draft:

```
|-- _drafts/
|   |-- a-draft-post.md
```

To preview your site with drafts, run jekyll serve or jekyll build with the --drafts switch. Each will be assigned the value modification time of the draft file for its date, and thus you will see currently edited drafts as the latest posts.
