Process of memory allocation for newly created objects and deletion for the unused ones is known as *memory management*. *Java* is a managed programming language i.e. it manages memory automatically with the help of a garbage collector,  garbage collector works in background to clean any unused objects to free the memory. Although the process of memory management in Java is automatic, however it is not guaranteed so knowing the concepts of memory management in Java will help you write highly optimized and robust applications.


## What is Java Virtual Machine (JVM)

>> The JVM loads the code, verifies the code, executes the code, manages memory (this includes allocating memory from the Operating System (OS), managing Java allocation including heap compaction and removal of garbage objects) and finally provides the runtime environment.

>> Generally, memory is divided into two big parts: the stack and the heap.
