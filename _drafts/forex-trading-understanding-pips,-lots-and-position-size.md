## Pip

Pip is abbreviation of **P**oint **i**n **p**rice, it is the smallest change in price an exchange can make. For currencies a **pip** is usually 100th of 1% or 4th decimal point *(0.00001)*.

### Example

1. For *EUR/USD* pair the price is *1.1314*.
2. The next price of this pair is *1.1315*.
3. So the difference is *0.00001*, i,e. *1 Pip*.

Some systems offer price in 5 digits.

1. For *EUR/USD* pair the price is *1.13175*.
2. The next price of this pair is *1.13190*.
3. So the difference is *0.00015*, i,e. *1.5 Pips*.

Pip is also known as tick.
